# SDT.project
My Project for sprint 4
https://sdt-project-ukrl.onrender.com

In this project, I built and deployed a web application dashboard to a cloud service using Streamlit. The app is a tool for simulating random events and provides an interactive dashboard where users can explore and visualize the results.
Tools and Technologies
Python: For coding and data processing.
Streamlit: To build the web app.
Pandas/Numpy: For data simulation.
Plotly/Matplotlib: For visualizations.
How to Run Locally
To run the app on your machine:
1.Clone the Repository:
>>git clone <repository-link> cd <project-folder> 
2.Install Dependencies:
>>pip install -r requirements.txt 
3.Run the App:
>>streamlit run app.py 
4.Access the Dashboard:
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 or the Streamlit link shown in the terminal.
Conclusion
This project provided me with experience in building and deploying a web application. It allowed me to combine software engineering and data visualization skills while working with tools like Streamlit.
